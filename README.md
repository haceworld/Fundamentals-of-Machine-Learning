# Fundamentals-of-Artificial-Intelligence-
About Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence. To understand How Artificial Intelligence actually works, one needs to deep dive into the various sub-domains of Artificial Intelligence and understand how those domains could be applied to the various fields of the industry.

# Machine Learning
ML teaches a machine how to make inferences and decisions based on past experience. It identifies patterns, analyses past data to infer the meaning of these data points to reach a possible conclusion without having to involve human experience. This automation to reach conclusions by evaluating data, saves a human time for businesses and helps them make a better decision.

# Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a ML technique. It teaches a machine to process inputs through layers in order to classify, infer and predict the outcome.

# Neural Networks
Neural Networks work on the similar principles as of Human Neural cells. They are a series of algorithms that captures the relationship between various underying variabes and processes the data as a human brain does.

# Natural Language Processingc
NLP is a science of reading, understanding, interpreting a language by a machine. Once a machine understands what the user intends to communicate, it responds accordingly.

# Computer Vision
Computer vision algorithms tries to understand an image by breaking down an image and studying different parts of the objects. This helps the machine classify and learn from a set of images, to make a better output decision based on previous observations.

# Cognitive Computing
Cognitive computing algorithms try to mimic a human brain by anaysing text/speech/images/objects in a manner that a human does and tries to give the desired output.
